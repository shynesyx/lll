* Machine Learning
** Time series
*** Applications
- 
*** Components of a times series
- Trend: Long-term directionality.
- Seasonality: Periodic fluctuations occurring at regular intervals, e,g., weekly, monthly, etc.
- Cyclicality: Longer-term fluctuations, mostly representative of economic or business cycles.
- Irregularity: noise, randomness, or residuals, which are unpredictable.
*** Visualization
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Seasonal plots
- Lag plots
- ACF and PACF
*** Feature engineering
- Missing values
- Outliers
**** Transformation
- Log transformation
- Box-Cox transformation
- Fourier transformation
**** Stationarity
Constant statistical properties, e.g., mean, variance, etc., over time.
***** Stationarity tests
- ADF
  - $H_0$: signal is not stationary
  - $H_a$: signal is stationary
- KPSS
  - $H_0$: signal is stationary
  - $H_a$: signal is not stationary
***** Remove trends
- Differencing
- de-trending
- rolling statistics
*** Forecast
**** Types of forecasts
- Point forecasts
- Interval forecasts
**** Basic models
- Explanatory model
- Autoregressive (AR) model
- Mixed model
- Simple moving average (MA)
- Simple exponential smoothing
- Holt
- Holt-Winters
**** ARIMA models
- AR
- MA
- ARMA
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- ARIMAX
- SARIMAX
- VARIMA
- FARIMA
**** Metrics
- MAE
- MAPE
- MSE
- RMSE
*** Python libraries
- statsmodels
